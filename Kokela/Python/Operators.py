# Arithmetic Operators
'''
Addition --> "+"
Subtraction --> "-"
Multiplication --> "*"
Division --> "/"
Modulus --> "%"
Exponentation --> "**"
Floor Division --> "//"
'''
A =10
B = 2

# print(A+B)
# print(A-B)
# print(A*B)
# print(A/B)
# print(A//B)
# print(A**B) --> 10*10*10=1000
# print(A%B)

# Comparision operator / Relation operator

# "==" --> Equal to 
# "!=" --> not equal to 
# ">" --> Greater then
# "<" --> Lesser then
# ">=" --> greater then or eqaul to
# "<=" --> lesser then or eqaul to

# Logical operators
# and 
# or
# not 

# Assignment operators
# "=" --> Assign --> a=5
# "+=" --> Add and assign -->   a+=5 --> a=a+5
# "-=" --> Sub & assign --> a-=5
# Addition --> "+="
# Subtraction --> "-=" ==> a=a-5
# Multiplication --> "*=" --> a=a*5
# Division --> "/="
# Modulus --> "%="
# Exponentation --> "**="
# Floor Division --> "//="

# Identity operators

# is --> returs True --> if both variables has same object
# is not --> returs true --> if the both variables are not same object

# A = [1,2,3,4]
# B = [1,2,3,4]
# C = A

# print(A is B) 
# print(A is C )

# Membership opertor

# in 
# not in 

# A = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(8 not in A)
